# Motivation

*  Logic (and data...) should live in only one place
*  Abstraction and isolation
*  Clarity

--

*  As an interpreted, interactive language, the __process__ for writing functions is as important as the laws and syntax of R

## Load the Gapminder data

[Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/about/) is a Swedish foundation that combats misconceptions about global development.  These are just a tiny exerpt of the full data available there -- containing populaton, life expectancy, deflated GDP per capita in $USD.

```{r start_func1}
library(gapminder)
glimpse(gapminder)
```

---

```{r}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, color = continent))  + 
  geom_line(aes(group = country), alpha = .5) + scale_color_brewer(type = 'qual') + 
  geom_boxplot(data = filter(gapminder, year %in% seq(from=1952, to = 2002, by = 20)), 
               aes(group = interaction(year,continent)), 
               width = 8, outlier.shape = NA, position = 'dodge') 
```

---

## Max - min

You've got a numeric vector--`lifeExp` or `pop` or `gdpPercap` -- and you want to compute the difference between its max and min. Perhaps you want to do this after you  slice up the Gapminder data by year, country, continent, or combinations thereof.

---

## Get something that works

First, develop some working .alert[code for interactive use, using a representative input], say `lifeExp`.

R functions that will be useful: `min()`, `max()`, `range()`:

```{r}
min(gapminder$lifeExp)
max(gapminder$lifeExp)
range(gapminder$lifeExp)
```

---

## Some natural solutions

```{r}
max(gapminder$lifeExp) - min(gapminder$lifeExp)
range(gapminder$lifeExp)[2] - range(gapminder$lifeExp)[1]
range(gapminder[['lifeExp']])[2] - range(gapminder[['lifeExp']])[1]
diff(range(gapminder$lifeExp))
```

Internalize this "answer" because our informal testing relies on you noticing departures from this.

### Skateboard $\gg$ perfectly formed rear-view mirror

.pull-left[

Build [that skateboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) before you build the car or some fancy car part. A limited-but-functioning thing is useful to learn the dimensions of a problem.

This is related to the [Telescope Rule](https://wiki.c2.com/?TelescopeRule)

> It is faster to make a four-inch mirror then a six-inch mirror than to make a six-inch mirror.

## Turn the working interactive code into a function

Add NO new functionality! Just write your very first R function.

```{r}
max_minus_min = function(x){
  max(x) - min(x)
}
max_minus_min(gapminder$lifeExp)
```

Check that you're getting the same answer as you did with your interactive code. Test it eyeball-o-metrically at this point.

---

## Test your function

### Test on new inputs

Pick some new artificial inputs where you know (at least approximately) what your function should return.

```{r}
max_minus_min(1:10)
max_minus_min(runif(1000))
```

I know that 10 minus 1 is 9. I know that random uniform [0, 1] variates will be between 0 and 1. Therefore max - min should be less than 1. If I take LOTS of them, max - min should be pretty close to 1.

It is intentional that I tested on integer input as well as floating point. Likewise, I like to use valid-but-random data for this sort of check.

---

### Test on real data but *different* real data

Back to the real world now. Two other quantitative variables are lying around: `gdpPercap` and `pop`. Let's have a go.

```{r}
max_minus_min(gapminder$gdpPercap)
max_minus_min(gapminder$pop)
```

Either check these results "by hand" or apply the "does that even make sense?" test.

---

### Test on weird stuff

Don't get truly diabolical (yet). Just make the kind of mistakes you can imagine making at 2am when, 3 years from now, you rediscover this useful function you wrote.

```{r error = TRUE}
max_minus_min(gapminder) ## hey sometimes things "just work" on data.frames!
max_minus_min(gapminder$country) ## factors are kind of like integer vectors, no?
max_minus_min("eggplants are purple") ## i have no excuse for this one
```

---

How happy are you with those error messages? You must imagine that some entire __script__ has failed and that you were hoping to just knit it without re-reading it. If a colleague or future you encountered these errors, how hard is it to pinpoint the usage problem?

---

### Application exercise

Browse to [rstudio cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/spaces/162296/project/3099211) and take a few minutes with a partner to try to break `max_minus_min`.


---

### I will scare you now

Here are some great examples students in UBC's STAT545 devised where the function __should break but it does not.__

```{r}
max_minus_min(gapminder[c('lifeExp', 'gdpPercap', 'pop')])
max_minus_min(c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE))
```

In the first case, a data.frame containing just the quantitative variables is eventually coerced into numeric vector. The second case is less odious -- a logical vector is converted to zeroes and ones.

---

## Check the validity of arguments

For functions that will be used again -- which is not all of them! -- it is good to check the validity of arguments. This implements a rule from [the Unix philosophy](https://homepage.cs.uri.edu/~thenry/resources/unix_art/ch01s06.html):

> Rule of Repair: When you must fail, fail noisily and as soon as possible.

---

### `stopifnot()`

I use it here to make sure the input `x` is a numeric vector.

```{r error = TRUE}
max_minus_min = function(x) {
  stopifnot(is.numeric(x))
  max(x) - min(x)
}
max_minus_min(gapminder)
max_minus_min(gapminder$country)
max_minus_min("eggplants are purple")
```

---

```{r error = TRUE}
max_minus_min(gapminder[c('lifeExp', 'gdpPercap', 'pop')])
max_minus_min(c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE))
```

And we see that it catches all of the self-inflicted damage we would like to avoid.

---

### if then stop

`stopifnot()` doesn't provide a very good error message. The next approach is very widely used. Put your validity check inside an `if()` statement and call `stop()` yourself, with a custom error message, in the body.

```{r error = TRUE}
max_minus_min = function(x) {
  if(!is.numeric(x)) {
    stop('I am so sorry, but this function only works for numeric input!\n',
         'You have provided an object of class: ', class(x)[1])
  }
  max(x) - min(x)
}
max_minus_min(gapminder)
```

---

## Error checking

In addition to a gratuitous apology, the error raised also contains two more pieces of helpful info:
  
* *Which* function threw the error.
* Hints on how to fix things: expected class of input vs actual class.

If it is easy to do so, I highly recommend this template: "you gave me THIS, but I need THAT".

The tidyverse style guide has a very useful [chapter on how to construct error messages](https://style.tidyverse.org/error-messages.html).

---

### `if()`: a first taste of flow control

```
if( <BOOLEAN 1> ){
  <STATEMENT 1>
} else if ( <BOOLEAN 2> ) {
  <STATEMENT 2>
} 
... # else if
else{
  <FINAL STATEMENT>
}
```

lets us alter the program behavior depending on conditions.  We'll see more other examples
of flow control when we discuss iteration with `for`, `while` `repeat`.

---

```{r, include = FALSE}
work_without_question = function(condition){
  print(str_c("Good capitalistic worker bee ", emo::ji("honey_pot")))
}

life_crisis = function(condition){
  warning("Joining a commune.")
}
```


```{r}
life = function(condition) {
  good_things = c("skiing", "cats", "health",
                  "wilderness", "coffee")
  if (sum(condition %in% good_things) >= 3) {
    condition = work_without_question(condition)
  } else{
    condition = life_crisis(condition)
  }
}
```

```{r}
life(c("cats", "health"))
life(c("cats", "skiing", "health"))
```

---

### `if` vs `ifelse`/`if_else`/`case_when`

*  Use `if_else`/`ifelse` or `case_when` selectively alter portions of a vector
*  Use `if` to change program logic depending on a **length one boolean**
   -  length > 1 will trigger a warning that you should treat as an error 
*  Rule of thumb: use `case_when`/`if_else`/`ifelse` in a `mutate` statement.  Otherwise think.

---

## Assertions: not just for functions!

Also use `stopifnot` and other types of .alert[assertions] for checks in data analytical scripts! E.g.:

-  No duplicates in primary keys: `stopifnot(all(!duplicated(data$primary_key)))`
-  Data are of the correct type (numeric not character): `stopifnot(is.numeric(data$column))`
-  Same number of rows after joining on primary keys: `stopifnot(nrow(data)==nrow(data_join))`

# Writing functions

## What goes in / what comes out?

- They take input(s) defined in the function definition

```{r eval=FALSE}
function([inputs separated by commas]){
  # what to do with those inputs
}
```

- By default they return the last value computed in the function

```{r eval=FALSE}
scrape_page = function(x){
  # do bunch of stuff with the input...
  
  # return a tibble
  tibble(...)
}
```

- You can define more outputs to be returned in a list as well as nice print methods (but we won't go there for now...)

## Naming functions

> "There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things." - Phil Karlton

---

## Naming functions

- Names should be short but clearly evoke what the function does

--
- Names should be verbs, not nouns

--
- Multi-word names should be separated by underscores (`snake_case` as opposed to `camelCase`)

--
- A family of functions should be named similarly (`scrape_page()`, `scrape_speech()` OR `str_remove()`, `str_replace()` etc.)

--
- Avoid overwriting existing (especially widely used) functions

```{r eval=FALSE}
# JUST DON'T
mean = function(x){ 
  x * 3 
  }
```
