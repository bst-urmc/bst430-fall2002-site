I used it to\r\nSet up team assignments\r\nPush edits to existing assignments\r\nClone all student repos for grading, branching, and other\r\nhousekeeping\r\nUnwatch student repos, so you aren’t buried in github spam whenever\r\nyour students make commits\r\nBranch against the initial commit (useful for grading via pull\r\nrequests)\r\nAt some point, I will post excerpts from the script I used to manage\r\nassignments.\r\nGrading with github\r\nclassrooms\r\nYou can use pull requests, but you’ll need to make sure you have a\r\nbranch created against the initial commit. (See previous bullet).\r\nAlthough you can do this post-hoc, life will be easier if you do it\r\nahead of time. I could not figure out a good way to collaborate with TAs\r\nin the grading without sending the students (pre-mature and possibly\r\nincorrect) feedback. Basically, a way to mute a pull request before it’s\r\nsubmitted would be useful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
