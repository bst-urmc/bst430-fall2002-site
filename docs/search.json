      "contents": "\r\nRstudio cloud\r\nStudents will need to link their rstudio cloud account to github and\r\nenable private repos. RSC is good about prompting for when attempting to\r\ncreate a project from a private repo.\r\nLess obviously, you will need to enable 3rd-party API access from\r\nthe GH classroom organization. Note that I don’t entirely understand the\r\nsecurity implications, rstudio probably should find a way to invite\r\naccess via the github API rather than requiring carte blanche\r\naccess.\r\nRemind students to use the class workspace on RSC, not their default\r\nworkspaces (or they’ll run out of compute..)\r\nIt’s amazing how much compute your class will burn. The calculated\r\nusage seemed to be about 2x what students self-reported that their\r\nhomework took. I only had 9 students, and don’t know if it would be\r\ntenable to use RSC in a larger classroom.\r\nGithub classrooms\r\nEven if you use the github classroom web api, you’ll want to install\r\nMine Cetinkaya-Rundel and colleagues’ excellent ghclass\r\npackage. I used it to\r\nSet up team assignments\r\nPush edits to existing assignments\r\nClone all student repos for grading, branching, and other\r\nhousekeeping\r\nUnwatch student repos, so you aren’t buried in github spam whenever\r\nyour students make commits\r\nBranch against the initial commit (useful for grading via pull\r\nrequests)\r\nAt some point, I will post excerpts from the script I used to manage\r\nassignments.\r\nGrading with github\r\nclassrooms\r\nYou can use pull requests, but you’ll need to make sure you have a\r\nbranch created against the initial commit. (See previous bullet).\r\nAlthough you can do this post-hoc, life will be easier if you do it\r\nahead of time. I could not figure out a good way to collaborate with TAs\r\nin the grading without sending the students (pre-mature and possibly\r\nincorrect) feedback. Basically, a way to mute a pull request before it’s\r\nsubmitted would be useful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
