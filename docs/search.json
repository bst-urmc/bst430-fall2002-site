      "contents": "\nRstudio cloud\nStudents will need to link their rstudio cloud account to github and enable private repos. RSC is good about prompting for when attempting to create a project from a private repo.\nLess obviously, you will need to enable 3rd-party API access from the GH classroom organization. Note that I don’t entirely understand the security implications, rstudio probably should find a way to invite access via the github API rather than requiring carte blanche access.\nRemind students to use the class workspace on RSC, not their default workspaces (or they’ll run out of compute..)\nIt’s amazing how much compute your class will burn. The calculated usage seemed to be about 2x what students self-reported that their homework took. I only had 9 students, and don’t know if it would be tenable to use RSC in a larger classroom.\nGithub classrooms\nEven if you use the github classroom web api, you’ll want to install Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel and colleagues’ excellent ghclass package. I used it to\nSet up team assignments\nPush edits to existing assignments\nClone all student repos for grading, branching, and other housekeeping\nUnwatch student repos, so you aren’t buried in github spam whenever your students make commits\nBranch against the initial commit (useful for grading via pull requests)\nAt some point, I will post excerpts from the script I used to manage assignments.\nGrading with github classrooms\nYou can use pull requests, but you’ll need to make sure you have a branch created against the initial commit. (See previous bullet). Although you can do this post-hoc, life will be easier if you do it ahead of time. I could not figure out a good way to collaborate with TAs in the grading without sending the students (pre-mature and possibly incorrect) feedback. Basically, a way to mute a pull request before it’s submitted would be useful.\n\n\n\n",
