In this assignment we explore the [2016 General Social Survey](https://gss.norc.org/Get-The-Data) data set. The GSS gathers data on contemporary American society in order to monitor and explain trends and constants in attitudes, behaviors, and attributes. Hundreds of trends have been tracked since 1972.

# Getting started

Go to the course GitHub organization and locate your homework repo, clone it in RStudio and open the R Markdown document.
Knit the document to make sure it compiles without errors.

## Warm up

Before we introduce the data, let's warm up with some simple exercises.
Update the YAML of your R Markdown file with your information, knit, commit, and push your changes.
Make sure to commit with a meaningful commit message.
Then, go to your repo on GitHub and confirm that your changes are visible in your Rmd **and** md files.
If anything is missing, commit and push again.

## Packages

We'll use the **tidyverse** package for much of the data wrangling and visualisation, the **tidymodels** package for modeling and inference, and the data lives in the **dsbox** package.
These packages are already installed for you.
You can load them by running the following in your Console:

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(dsbox)
```

## Data

The data can be found in the **dsbox** package, and it's called `gss16`.
Since the dataset is distributed with the package, we don't need to load it separately; it becomes available to us when we load the package.
You can find out more about the dataset by inspecting its documentation, which you can access by running `?gss16` in the Console or using the Help menu in RStudio to search for `gss16`.
You can also find this information [here](https://rstudio-education.github.io/dsbox/reference/gss16.html).

# Exercises

## Scientific research

In this section we're going to build a model to predict whether someone agrees or doesn't agree with the following statement:

> Even if it brings no immediate benefits, scientific research that advances the frontiers of knowledge is necessary and should be supported by the federal government.

The responses to the question on the GSS about this statement are in the `advfront` variable.

```{marginfigure}
It's important that you don't recode the NAs, just the remaining levels.
```

1.  Re-level the `advfront` variable such that it has two levels: `Strongly agree` and "`Agree"` combined into a new level called `agree` and the remaining levels (except `NA`s) combined into "`Not agree"`. Then, re-order the levels in the following order: `"Agree"` and `"Not agree"`. Finally, `count()` how many times each new level appears in the `advfront` variable.

```{marginfigure}
You can do this in various ways. One option is to use the `str_detect()` function to detect the existence of words like liberal or conservative. Note that these sometimes show up with lowercase first letters and sometimes with upper case first letters. To detect either in the `str_detect()` function, you can use "[Ll]iberal" and "[Cc]onservative". But feel free to solve the problem however you like, this is just one option!
```

2.  Combine the levels of the `polviews` variable such that levels that have the word "liberal" in them are lumped into a level called `"Liberal"` and those that have the word conservative in them are lumped into a level called `"Conservative"`. Then, re-order the levels in the following order: `"Conservative"` , `"Moderate"`, and `"Liberal"`. Finally, `count()` how many times each new level appears in the `polviews` variable.
3.  Create a new data frame called `gss16_advfront` that includes the variables `advfront`, `educ`, `polviews`, and `wrkstat`. Then, use the `drop_na()` function to remove rows that contain `NA`s from this new data frame. 

4.  Split the data into training (75%) and testing (25%) data sets. Make sure to set a seed before you do the `initial_split()`. Call the training data `gss16_train` and the testing data `gss16_test`. Sample code is provided below. Use these specific names to make it easier to follow the rest of the instructions.

```{r eval=FALSE}
set.seed(___)
gss16_split = initial_split(gss16_advfront)
gss16_train = training(gss16_split)
gss16_test  = testing(gss16_split)
```

5.  Create a recipe with the following steps for predicting `advfront` from `polviews`, `wrkstat`, and `educ`.
    Name this recipe `gss16_rec_1`.
    (We'll create one more recipe later, that's why we're naming this recipe `_1`.) Sample code is provided below.

    -   `step_other()` to pool values that occur less than 10% of the time (`threshold = 0.10`) in the `wrkstat` variable into `"Other"`.

    -   `step_dummy()` to create dummy variables for `all_nominal()` variables that are predictors, i.e. `all_predictors()`

```{r eval=FALSE}
gss16_rec_1 = recipe(___ ~ ___, data = ___) %>%
  step_other(wrkstat, threshold = ___, other = "Other") %>%
  step_dummy(all_nominal(), -all_outcomes())
```

6.  Specify a logistic regression model using `"glm"` as the engine. Name this specification `gss16_spec`. Sample code is provided below.

```{r eval=FALSE}
gss16_spec = ___() %>%
  set_engine("___")
```

7.  Build a workflow that uses the recipe you defined (`gss16_rec`) and the model you specified (`gss16_spec`). Name this workflow `gss16_wflow_1`. Sample code is provided below.

```{r eval=FALSE}
gss16_wflow_1 = workflow() %>%
  add_model(___) %>%
  add_recipe(___)
```

8.  Perform 5-fold cross validation.
    specifically,

    -   split the training data into 5 folds (don't forget to set a seed first!),

    -   apply the workflow you defined earlier to the folds with `fit_resamples()`, and

    -   `collect_metrics()` and comment on the consistency of metrics across folds (you can get the area under the ROC curve and the accuracy for each fold by setting `summarize = FALSE` in `collect_metrics()`)

    -   report the average area under the ROC curve and the accuracy for all cross validation folds `collect_metrics()`

```{r eval=FALSE}
set.seed(___)
gss16_folds = vfold_cv(___, v = ___)

gss16_fit_rs_1 = gss16_wflow_1 %>%
  fit_resamples(___)

collect_metrics(___, summarize = FALSE)
collect_metrics(___)
```

9.  Now, try a different, simpler model: predict `advfront` from only `polviews` and `educ`.
    Specifically,

    -   update the recipe to reflect this simpler model specification (and name it `gss16_rec_2`),
    -   redefine the workflow with the new recipe (and name this new workflow `gss16_wflow_2`),
    -   perform cross validation, and
    -   report the average area under the ROC curve and the accuracy for all cross validation folds `collect_metrics()`.

10. Comment on which model performs better (one including `wrkstat`, model 1, or the one excluding `wrkstat`, model 2) on the training data based on area under the ROC curve.

11. Fit both models to the testing data, plot the ROC curves for the predictions for both models, and calculate the areas under the ROC curve.
    Does your answer to the previous exercise hold for the testing data as well?
    Explain your reasoning.
    Note: If you haven't yet done so, you'll need to first train your workflows on the training data with the following, and then use these fit objects to calculate predictions for the test data.


## Extra credit

12. (**Extra credit**) Refit your model and recipe from Ex5-Ex8 using [glmnet](https://parsnip.tidymodels.org/reference/logistic_reg.html).  Select the `penalty` and `mixture` tuning parameters by [cross-validation over the training data](https://www.tidymodels.org/start/tuning/).

13. (**Extra credit**) Generate a plot comparing the test-data ROC from your model in Ex 12, the results from Ex 11.

```{r eval=FALSE}
gss16_fit_1 = gss16_wflow_1 %>%
  fit(gss16_train)

gss16_fit_2 = gss16_wflow_2 %>%
  fit(gss16_train)
```

## Part ii: (many linear models)

14.  Using `gapminder`, fit a linear model over all countries on `log(pop)` vs (years-1990), so that the intercept reflects the log-population in 1990.  Interpet the slope and intercept in terms of the unlogged variables.

```{r}
library(gapminder)
```

15.  Now, completing the code below, and following the example from [lecture 16](https://urmc-bst.github.io/bst430-fall2021-site/lecture/l16-multivariate-lm.html#54), fit this model per country.  In a table, report the top 3 and bottom 3 countries in terms of the population growth rates, and their 95\% confidence intervals.

```{r, error = TRUE}
fit_pop = function(){
  ##Fill in this function
}

many_fits = gapminder %>% 
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarize(fit = fit_pop(across()))  %>%
  ungroup()

filter(many_fits, country == 'India')$fit[[1]]
filter(many_fits, country == 'Italy')$fit[[1]]
```


```{r, error = TRUE}
many_fits %>% 
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(tidy_out = list(tidy(___))) %>%
  unnest(___)
```
