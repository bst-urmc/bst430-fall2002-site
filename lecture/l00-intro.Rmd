# Other syllabus items

## Homework and github usage

* Homework will be posted, turned-in, and graded on github classrooms.
* We will shortly discuss logistics of this and how your use of this will be a component of your grade
* I will sometimes accept a late assignments if I see progress and a consistent commit history in that assignment. If I do not see any progress in an assignment, I will not accept a late submission.
* I permit corrections and regrades to assignments to receive up to 75% of original credit.

## Academic honesty and programming

1.  You may generally work together<sup>1</sup>.
2.  You may generally google it, but cite your sources and see the next item.
3.  Write your own solutions and *own code*.  **This generally means no copy-paste!**  Let's look at [the syllabus](../static/Syllabus_DRAFT.pdf) for complete details.
4.  Exception: labs, which will be marked as such, are collaborative within each group.


### Code of conduct
Respect each other<sup>2</sup>.  The UR harassment and discrimination policy applies<sup>3</sup>.
