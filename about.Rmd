```


## Rstudio cloud

1.  Students will need to link their rstudio cloud account to github and enable private repos.  RSC is good about prompting for when attempting to create a project from a private repo.
2.  Less obviously, you will need to enable 3rd-party API access from the GH classroom organization.  Note that I don't entirely understand the security implications, rstudio probably should find a way to invite access via the github API rather than requiring carte blanche access.
4.  Remind students to use the class workspace on RSC, not their default workspaces (or they'll run out of compute..)
5.  It's amazing how much compute your class will burn.  The calculated usage seemed to be about 2x what students self-reported that their homework took.  I only had 9 students, and don't know if it would be tenable to use RSC in a larger classroom.

## Github classrooms
 
Even if you use the github classroom web api, you'll want to install Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel and colleagues' excellent [ghclass](https://rundel.github.io/ghclass/articles/articles/ghclass.html) package.  I used it to

*  Set up team assignments
*  Push edits to existing assignments
*  Clone all student repos for grading, branching, and other housekeeping
*  Unwatch student repos, so you aren't buried in github spam whenever your students make commits
*  Branch against the initial commit (useful for grading via pull requests)

At some point, I will post excerpts from the script I used to manage assignments.

### Grading with github classrooms

You can use pull requests, but you'll need to make sure you have a branch created against the initial commit.
(See previous bullet).  Although you can do this post-hoc, life will be easier if you do it ahead of time.
I could not figure out a good way to collaborate with TAs in the grading without sending the students (pre-mature and possibly incorrect) feedback.  Basically, a way to mute a pull request before it's submitted would be useful.
